# cars-inequality
Group project for SICSS 2019
This repository represents a incomplete version for a web-scraping mini project during the Summer Institute for Computational Social Science in Bamberg 2019 (https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/bamberg/). 

The project aimed to utilize web-craping techniques with a social analysis of ebay Kleinanzeigen (German equivalent of US craigslist) with indicators of income and potential economic inequality. The scraper and a rudimentary visualization, but further analyses were not feasible during the 4 day project. In this repository you find first results.
